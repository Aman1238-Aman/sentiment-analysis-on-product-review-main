Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

🧠 Project Overview:
--------------------
This project analyzes product reviews from Amazon and classifies them as **Positive 😊** or **Negative 😞** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The model is trained using labeled reviews from a public dataset. A simple and interactive web interface (built with Flask) allows users to input a 
review and view the predicted sentiment along with a probability chart.





📌 Dataset Information:
-----------------------
Dataset used: [Amazon Reviews Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)
- Format: `__label__2` (positive), `__label__1` (negative)
- Note: After analyzing the dataset, I found that it does **not include neutral labels**. Hence, this model is designed to classify only **positive** and **negative** sentiments.

✅ Example:
Review: "This is the best product I’ve ever bought!"
Prediction: Positive 😊
📌 Notes:
This is a binary classification task due to the dataset structure.

If a new dataset with neutral labels is available, the model can be updated for 3-class classification.
